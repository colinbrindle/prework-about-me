      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Colin (with one "L"). Nice to meet you!</p>
      <p>>I'm a former management consultant looking to develop my coding skills and break into the tech world :)</p>
      <h1>Where I'm from</h1>
      <p>I like to say Seattle, WA and Taipei, Taiwan -- where my dad and mom are from -- but I moved around a bit growing up, so it's hard to give one answer</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies include hiking, movies, video games, and especially cooking!</p>
      <p>(One of my favorite things to cook is tomato sauce. A recipe that I highly recommend following, and keep coming back to, is Samin Nosrat's pasta alla pomarola from her cookbook Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.)</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Ideally no job ;)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in O4W Atlanta with my roommate and wonderful cat</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love the idea of being able to create a tangible product that people use</p>
